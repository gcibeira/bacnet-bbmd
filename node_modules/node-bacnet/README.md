# node-bacnet

[![node-bacnetLogo64](images/bacnet-icon-quad64.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-bacnet)

The BACnet® protocol library written in pure JavaScript.

BACnet® is a protocol to interact with building automation devices defined by ASHRAE.

## Usage

Add node-bacnet to your project by using:

``` sh
npm install --save node-bacnet
```

The API documentation is available under **[GitHub Page of Docs](https://biancoroyal.github.io/node-bacstack/)**.

### Features

The BACnet® standard defines a wide variety of services as part of the
specification. While node-bacnet tries to be as complete as possible,
following services are already supported at this point in time:

| Service                        | Execute                                                                                | Handle                                                                        |
